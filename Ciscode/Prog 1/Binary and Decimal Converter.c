Nolvin uses all types of numbers in engineering, especially binary and decimal numbers. To make his studies easier, he wants to build a converter for the two number systems. This converter should:
1. Ask the user to input a number.
2. Ask the user to input the type of number system the number belongs to.
3. Using a switch statement, call the corresponding calculations/functions for the chosen number system to convert it to the other system.
4. Output the conversion result.

HINTS:
- For the binary to decimal conversion, utilize the modulo and division operators to break down the number by digit, then use the left shift (<<) operator to handle exponents.
- For the decimal to binary conversion, utilize the modulo and division operators and convert the results into an array, then print the result out by array element.
